# Introduction to Regular Expressions (Regex) Tutorial
Welcome to the "Introduction to Regular Expressions (Regex)" tutorial! In this tutorial, we will delve into the fascinating world of regular expressions, commonly referred to as regex. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. Whether you're a programmer, a data analyst, or someone who deals with textual data, understanding regex can greatly enhance your capabilities.

## Summary
In this tutorial, we will focus on a specific regular expression that validates email addresses. Here's the regex we'll be exploring:

##  Regex 

`^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`
This regex is used to validate the format of email addresses. We'll break down each component of this regex, explain its purpose, and provide examples to illustrate its usage.

1. ^: Anchors the regex to the beginning of the string, ensuring that the match starts from the beginning of the text.

2. [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+: This part matches the username portion of the email address. Here's what each component means:

   - [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]: This is a character class that matches any lowercase letter, uppercase letter, digit, or the characters ._%+-. These characters are typically allowed in email usernames.

   - +: The plus symbol indicates that the preceding character class (or group) should occur one or more times. This allows for a valid username to have multiple characters.

3. @: Matches the literal "@" symbol, which separates the username from the domain in an email address.

4. [a-zA-Z0-9.-]+: This part matches the domain name portion of the email address. Similar to the username:

    - [a-zA-Z0-9.-]: This character class matches lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and the characters .-, which are typically allowed in domain names.

5. +: Again, the plus symbol allows for multiple characters in the domain name.

6. `\.`: This matches a literal period (dot) character. The backslash (\) is used to escape the period because the period has a special meaning in regex.

    - [a-zA-Z]{2,}: This part matches the top-level domain (TLD) of the email address, which is typically composed of two or more letters. Here's what's happening:

    - [a-zA-Z]: This character class matches any single uppercase or lowercase letter.

7. {2,}: The curly braces indicate a quantifier. {2,} means the preceding character class should occur at least two times or more. This ensures that the TLD is composed of at least two letters.

$: Anchors the regex to the end of the string, ensuring that the match extends to the end of the text.

## Anchors

Anchors are special characters that mark the position of a regex match in relation to the start and end of a line. The regex ^ at the beginning and $ at the end of our email regex are anchors. The ^ asserts the position at the start of the string, and the $ asserts the position at the end of the string.

<a id="quantifiers"></a>
## Quantifiers

Quantifiers define how many times a character or a group of characters can appear in a regex match. In our email regex, the + symbol after [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-] and [a-zA-Z0-9.-] indicates that one or more of these characters can appear.

<a id="grouping-constructs"></a>
## Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs are used to treat multiple characters as a single unit. The parentheses (...) are used for grouping in regex. In our regex, we use parentheses to group parts of the email address and for the domain extension.

<a id="#bracket-expressions"></a>
## Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions define a set of characters that can match a single character position. In our regex, [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-] and [a-zA-Z0-9.-] are bracket expressions defining valid characters for the username and domain segments of the email address.

<a id="#the-or-operator"></a>
## The OR Operator

The OR operator (|) allows you to match either the expression on the left or the one on the right. Our regex doesn't use the OR operator, but it's a fundamental concept in regex.

<a id="flags"></a>
## Flags

Flags are optional parameters that modify the behavior of regex matching. Common flags include case-insensitivity and global matching. Our regex doesn't use flags, but they're important to know.

<a id="character-escapes"></a>
## Character Escapes

Character escapes are used to match special characters that have a predefined meaning in regex. For example, \. is used to match a literal period. In our regex, we escape the dot in \. to match a literal dot in the email address.
